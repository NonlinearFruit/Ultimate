Ultimate.jar is an executable jar, so all it requires is a Java 8 runtime environment. The directory with Ultimate.jar should also contain the HotKeys, Cmds, Typing, and Custom directories from this repo. Once these requirements have been met, Ultimate should properly execute on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
